# 🧰 Python Portfolio

This section highlights my work in Python, split into three main areas:  

---

## 🐍 100 Days of Python
A structured learning journey that builds Python skills step by step.  
From simple scripts to applied security and data projects, this track demonstrates consistent growth.  

➡️ [View the 100 Days of Python Progress](100-days/day01/README.md)

## 🔬 Independent Projects
Self-directed projects that apply Python to **real-world problems** — automation, data analysis, and cybersecurity tooling.  

➡️ [Explore Independent Projects](projects/README.md)

## 🎓 WGU D335 Coursework
Coursework and practice exercises from my **WGU Introduction to Programming in Python** class (D335).  
This section shows how academic work connects directly to portfolio projects.  

➡️ [View WGU D335 Notes](wgu-d335/README.md)

## 🧪 Playground
A sandbox for experimenting with snippets, quick scripts, and testing out ideas before they become full projects.
