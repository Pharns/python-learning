# Day 01 – Hello World 👋

## 🐍 Concept
The very first step: writing and running a simple Python script.  
**Goal:** Get comfortable with your editor, environment, and Git workflow.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- [x] Write and run a simple Python script
- [x] Configure Git repo for Python learning
- [x] Verify CI pipeline (Black, Ruff, Mypy, Pytest)

---

## 📜 Code
```python
print("Hello, World!")
````

---

## ✅ What I Learned

* How to create and run a `.py` script.
* How to commit and push changes to GitHub.
* Confirmed that my CI pipeline (Black, Ruff, Mypy, Pytest) runs correctly.

---

## 📓 Notes & Reflections

* First run went smoothly — “Hello, World!” printed without issues.
* CI/CD validation gave confidence that the repo is set up properly.
* This foundation ensures future days build on a working environment.
