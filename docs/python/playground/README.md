# 🏖️ Python Playground

This folder is my sandbox for experimenting with Python.  
Here I can try out ideas, test snippets, and build mini-projects without worrying about structure or coursework rules.

## Possible Uses
- Small utility scripts
- Testing new libraries
- Prototyping functions or classes
- Random fun projects

## Notes
Anything in here may be messy, half-finished, or experimental — that’s the point!
