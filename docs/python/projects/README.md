# 🐍 Python Projects

This folder is the hub for my **independent Python projects** outside of structured coursework.  
Projects here often build on what I’ve learned from **WGU’s D335 course** and the **100 Days of Python Bootcamp**, but go a step further by applying those skills to real-world problems, automation, or security tooling.
