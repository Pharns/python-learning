## 🔧 How I Work
- **On iPad:** I use [Pythonista](https://apps.apple.com/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097) + [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) to code and sync with GitHub.
- **On Desktop:** I use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) with Python, Git, and testing extensions.
- Code is versioned with Git and synced between devices via GitHub.
